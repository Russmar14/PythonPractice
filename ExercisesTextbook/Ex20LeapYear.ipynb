    "It takes about 365.25 days for the earth to revolve around the sun. This slight offset would cause our 365-day calendar to become inaccurate over time. Therefore, leap years have an extra day, February 29th. A leap year occurs on all years divisible by four (e.g., 2016, 2020, 2024, and so on). However, the exception to this rule is that years divisible by one hundred (e.g., 2100, 2200, 2300, and so on) arenâ€™t leap years. And the exception to this exception is that years divisible by four hundred (e.g., 2000, 2400, and so on) are leap years.\n",
