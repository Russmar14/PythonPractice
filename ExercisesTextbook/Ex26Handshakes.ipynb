Between four people, there are six handshakes; five people, ten handshakes, and so on. This exercise explores the full range of possible handshaking combinations with nested for loops.\n",

The function prints out 'X shakes hands with Y', where X and Y are every possible pair of handshakes between the people in the list. No duplicates are permitted: if “Alice shakes hands with Bob” appears in the output, then “Bob shakes hands with Alice” should not appear.\n",
