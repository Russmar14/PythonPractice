    "You can represent a date with three integers for the year, month, and day, but this doesn’t mean that any integers represent a valid date. After all, there is no 13th month of the year or 32nd day of any month. This exercise has you check if a year/month/day combination is valid, given that different months have different numbers of days. You’ll use the solution you wrote for Exercise #20, “Leap Year” as part of the solution for this exercise, so finish Exercise #20 before attempting this one.\n",

    "Write an isValidDate() function with parameters year, month, and day. The function should return True if the integers provided for these parameters represent a valid date. Otherwise, the function returns False. Months are represented by the integers 1 (for January) to 12 (for December) and days are represented by integers 1 up to 28, 29, 30, or 31 depending on the month and year. Your solution should import your leapyear.py program from Exercise #20 for its isLeapYear() function, as February 29th is a valid date on leap years.\n",
